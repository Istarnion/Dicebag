Dicebag
=======

Dicebag is a simple dice expression evaluator. See `Dicebag/DiceRoller.cs` for details on the accepted grammar, but in essence, it handles expressions on the form `1d20+4`.

Syntax errors (including empty or null input) are reported in the Message of thrown exceptions.

No dependencies.

## NOTE
The API is not yet stable, and the code is not yet optimized and may very well be very slow.
